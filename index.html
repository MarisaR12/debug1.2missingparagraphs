    <h1>Types of Chocolate</h1>
    <!-- I put a p in the ending tag since it's a paragraph and it was missing that-->
    <p>This page will explain differences between milk, dark, and Ruby chocolate.</p>
    <h2>Milk</h2>
    <p>Milk chocolate is solid chocolate made with either liquid milk, powdered milk, or condensed milk. </p>
    <h2>Dark</h2>
    <p>Unlike milk chocolate, dark chocolate contains no milk in it, instead using more cocoa, giving it a darker color and making it more bitter.</p>
    <h2>Ruby</h2>
    <p>Ruby chocolate is made from a different cocoa bean altogether. It is made from the ruby cocoa bean, which has a red color and different flavor.</p>
    <!-- I put an angle bracket at the ened of the tag because it had a period at the end.-->
